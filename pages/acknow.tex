\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
This project was made possible by the unfaltering support and guidance of a number of teachers and well-wishers, without whom we could not have gone so far. We wish to express sincere gratitude to Dr. Indra Prasad Acharya for the time and effort he has given to guide us. We are indebted for support and confidence he has shown upon us throughout the project, without which project could not have been imagined.

We would also like to thank Madhusudhan K.C. sir his inspired assistance and guidance in getting knowledge and data whenever required. We also like to remember Manoj Subedi sir and Multilab for providing us data without any inconvience. We also like to thank our family members as well as friends who were the helping hands during this project.

We would like to thank IOE for providing us such an opportunity to perform this project as a part of final year project.
